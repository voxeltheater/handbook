### DMX Profile

*When using QLab as the lighting console, we recommend selecting the 5-channel (`RGB`) Profile.* More advanced direct modes are not color-calibrated so different instruments will not match.

| Address | Function  |
| ------- | --------- |
| 1       | Red       |
| 2       | Green     |
| 3       | Blue      |
| 4       |           |
| 5       | Strobe    |

We also recommend setting the `White Point` to `3200K`, which can be found under `Advanced Settings` > `LED Settings`.
