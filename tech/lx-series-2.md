# ETC Source Four LED Series 2

- Profile-style instrument
- Red, Amber, Lime, Green, Cyan, Blue, Indigo
- Interchangeable lenses
- 5-Pin DMX In/Out
- PowerCON In/Out

### DMX Profile

*When using QLab as the lighting console, we recommend selecting the 5-channel (`RGB`) Profile.*
Direct modes (15-channel) are not color-calibrated so different instruments will not match!

| 1       | Red       |
| 2       | Green     |
| 3       | Blue      |
