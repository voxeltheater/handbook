# Overview

## Work Lights
Wall switches for the work lights are located on the East wall, at three separate locations.
- East wall, by roll door
- East wall, stage level near lobby railing
- East wall, lobby level near stairs to mezzanine
- South wall, stage level at bottom of ramp

At this time, the work lights can only be controlled from these stations. We're working on it.

The work lights will turn on automatically if the fire alarm is activated.

## Stage Lights

### Control
The Voxel uses QLab as our lighting console. QLab sends Art-Net universes to our [eDMX4](lx-edmx4.md) DMX nodes. DMX connections are available at (6) connection panels in the grid.  

Any lighting console outputting Art-Net or sACN can also be connected to The Voxel via any ethernet connection on the stage floor or grid.

### Instruments
See [Lighting Instruments](lx-instruments.md)

### DMX Cable
The Voxel has a stock of 5-pin DMX cable available for use. DMX cable is stored in the `Lighting` road case. This case is stored backstage near the roll door. Cables are color-coded by length, see [Cable Color Code](cables.md#color-code).
