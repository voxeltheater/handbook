Company Switches are a way to access large amounts of electrical power for equipment such as dimmer racks. All our Company Switches have Cam-Type connections as well as lug terminals. There are no flipped grounds/neutrals. Please consult the TD if you have equipment to connect to a Company Switch.

## Extension Cords
Extension cords are stored in the black road case labeled `Extension Cords`. Cables are color-coded by length, see [Cable Color Code](cables.md#color-code). The road case is stored backstage near the roll door.

Most electrical breakers are located in the Electrical Closet backstage. It is only accessible to Voxel staff. Please ask the TD if a breaker is tripped.
