# DMXking eDMX4 PRO
The eDMX4 converts IP-based lighting data (Art-Net, sACN) into (4) DMX outputs.

#### eDMX4 PRO
Can be clamped to a pipe and connected to [LX Net](network.md) for 4 additional DMX ouputs whenever you need it. We have two units available for free use.

#### eDMX4 PRO DIN
Mounts to a DIN equipment rail. We use them inside our control rack to output to all the DMX connections in the grid.

## Configuration
The settings on all eDMX products can be adjusted from DMXking's free [eDMX Configuration Utility](https://dmxking.com/downloads-list).
