## Dante
Dante is the protocol that connects all the different pieces of our audio system together. Dante is a way to route dozens of audio signals over ethernet cables and ethernet switches, instead of using analog audio lines. For more about how Dante works, see [Dante](audio-dante.md)

## Inputs
Any device that outputs Dante, such as our Soundcraft console and ULXD4Q Wireless Mic Receiver, can be connected to the Dante network as a Transmitter. We can also digitize up to 4 analog sources in our analog audio patch bay.
