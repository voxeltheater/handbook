# Audio
## Dante
Dante is the protocol that connects all the different pieces of our audio system together. Dante is a way to route dozens of audio signals over ethernet cables and ethernet switches, instead of using analog audio lines. Using [Dante Controller](audio-dante.md#dante-controller), any input in the system can be digitally routed to anywhere else, such as a console input or an amplifier. For more about how Dante works, see [Dante](audio-dante.md)

## Inputs
Any device that outputs Dante, such as our [Soundcraft Vi1](audio-console.md) console and [ULXD4Q Wireless Mic Receiver](audio-ulxd4q.md), can be connected to the Dante network as a Transmitter. We can also digitize up to 4 analog sources in our analog audio patch bay.

## Outputs
The Voxel uses a d&b system to handle all output processing and speakers. It includes:
- DS100 Audio Engine, to process delays, EQ, and spatial audio
- DS10 Audio Network Bridge, to convert Dante channels to AES outputs
- D20 Amplifiers, which use AES inputs and drive speakers

## Standard Configurations
We have four standard speaker arrangements available. See [Speaker Configurations](audio-configurations.md)

## The Aux
For connecting an iPhone or other simple aux input to the sound system, we provide a [Radial DAN-TX2 Dante Interface](audio-dan-tx2.md). It has converts the analog signal from the device into Dante. It can be connected to any ethernet port in the building, just let the TD know which one you need!
