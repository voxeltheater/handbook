# OSC Dictionary

The Voxel itself has a growing API for OSC, allowing you to control it from any device or software which can send OSC messages. What follows here is a complete dictionary of The Voxelâ€™s OSC implementation.

This API is designed to integrate aspects of the building, such as HVAC and work lights, into your show's cue list. For example, you can turn down the lobby lights automatically when you run a top-of-show cue.

*The Voxel OSC API must be used over UDP transport layer. The Voxel listens for incoming OSC at `voxel.local:5333`*
