# Network

## Ethernet
We have hardwired RJ45 Ethernet ports throughout the building (including at grid level), which each run to a central patch bay. We can connect any port to one of 2 distinct networks for you: `Internet` and `Theatre`. The Theatre network is set up to manage Dante, Art-Net, and show control traffic. PoE is available on every port.

## LX Net
There are (8) EtherCON connections available in the grid that are reserved for lighting equipment such as consoles and DMX nodes.

## Ethernet Switches
All traffic on the Theatre network is routed through a pair of Netgear M4300-52G-PoE+ switches. These switches can handle specialized bandwidth-intensive tasks such as NDI Video, as well as handling IP Audio such as Dante, sACN, and Art-Net.
