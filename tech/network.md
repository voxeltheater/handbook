# Network

## Ethernet
We have hardwired RJ45 Ethernet ports throughout the building (including at grid level), which each run to a central patch bay. We can connect any port to one of 2 distinct networks for you: `Internet` and `Theatre`. The Theatre network is set up to manage Dante, Art-Net, and show control traffic. PoE is available on every port.

## LX Net
There are (8) EtherCON connections available in the grid that are reserved for lighting equipment such as consoles and DMX nodes.

### Ethernet Switches
All traffic on the Theatre network is routed through a pair of **Netgear M4300-52G-PoE+** switches. These switches can handle specialized bandwidth-intensive tasks such as NDI Video, as well as handling IP Audio such as Dante, sACN, and Art-Net.

### Internet Connection
The Voxel's Internet service is from Comcast, though a cable modem. The advertised speed is **300Mbps download** and **30Mbps upload**. Actual speeds may vary. For reference, YouTube and other streaming services recommend upload speeds of 6 Mbps for streaming HD 1080p video at 30 fps.
