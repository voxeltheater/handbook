# The Voxel Handbook

This manual is a very early first draft of a User Manual for the Voxel Theater. It will eventually be translated into a PDF document with proper formatting and fonts.

This document is intended to be edited easily, refined collaboratively, and iterated upon quickly. We expect it to take time and many revisions.

The overall goal of this user manual is to write thorough and friendly documentation for the building. Similarly to writing documentation for a product like QLab, the documentation for the building should allow both beginners and experts to educate themselves about the space at the level of detail they need.

## Introduction

Welcome to The Voxel! The goal of this user manual is to provide friendly and thorough documentation for the building. This document starts with a high-level overview of the space, and then dives into many details, including troubleshooting guides and examples of how you might configure and set up the space in different scenarios.

If you have questions this manual does not answer, please email td@voxel.org for help!


### Overview

The Voxel is a privately owned, 8,000 square foot blackbox theater in the heart of Baltimore city.

By day, The Voxel is the teaching center and research laboratory of Figure 53, a small but mighty Baltimore-based company whose software runs live performances in over 100 countries around the world.

By night, The Voxel is a theater, incubator, and resource for performing artists in Baltimore and across the country.

The performance space is 50' by 36'-6", and has a 20' grid.


### History

The theater was built in 1946 and was a popular destination for moviegoers through the late 1980s. It fell into disrepair and went through numerous owners until we purchased it in 2015. We performed a ground-up renovation and reopened the theater in 2020 as a blackbox theater designed for live performance.

## Safety

### Building Capacity
The Voxel has a strict maximum occupancy of 300 people, including performers and crew. Most projects at The Voxel are well under this limit.

### Fire Exits
The Voxel has four emergency exits- the front doors, two backstage, and one in the Green Room. If stage curtains block visibility to exit signs, we will provide additional signs.

### Fire Alarm
The fire alarm system is activated by heat sensors in our ventillation system, in addition to pull stations throughout the building. We do not have "smoke detectors" that can be triggered by smoke/haze machines. If the alarm is activated, emergency lighting will turn on throughout the building.

### First Aid
A large first aid kit is stored in the Green Room microwave cabinet. If you use something from it, please let out Facilities Manager know so they can re-stock.


## Access

### Security

The Voxel is equipped with an RFID tag security and entry system. Guests have access to the venue by way of a designated key fob and pin code. Generally speaking, and subject to the terms of our official agreement with guest artists, you may access the venue at any time of the day or night during your time here. You are responsible for disarming the security system upon arrival, securing the building while occupied, and arming and securing the building upon exit. Securing the building includes ensuring all doors or access points are fully closed and all door locks or latches are engaged.

> If you forget your fob or pin code, Voxel staff can remotely open the venue for you. There is a $10 per fob replacement fee in the event a fob is lost or not returned.


### Accessibility

The Voxel is ADA compliant, offering a ramp to the lower stage level. You can access all public areas of the theater without using stairs. We also offer accessible bathrooms, including a private single-stall family restroom with a changing station.

The private mezzanine level is not accessible except by stairs.


### Parking

The Voxel does not have a dedicated parking lot, but there is ample street parking near the theater. Street parking is FREE during [days and times].

`[ToDo: map of street parking]`

There is LIMITED parking for 4 vehicles in marked spaces near the stage door. PLEASE DO NOT PARK behind any other building on Maryland Avenue; all other parking areas along the alley are reserved for the people who rent and own those row houses. Please be a good neighbor while you are here, and respect other peopleâ€™s space.
