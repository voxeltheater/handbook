# FAQ

### Can I paint the stage floor?

### Can I screw into the stage floor?

### Can I mop the stage floor?

Please NOT wet-mop the stage floor, but you can dry-mop it. Water can damage the floor.

Not yet, but we're working on it!

You can hang curtains anywhere on the pipe grid where there are black 2‚Äù pipes. You can view a blueprint of the pipe grid in Voxel Drawings. The Voxel does not use curtain tracks.
